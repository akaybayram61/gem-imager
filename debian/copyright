License: Libarchive
 The libarchive distribution as a whole is Copyright by Tim Kientzle
 and is subject to the copyright notice reproduced at the bottom of
 this file.
 
 Each individual file in this distribution should have a clear
 copyright/licensing statement at the beginning of the file.  If any do
 not, please let me know and I will rectify it.  The following is
 intended to summarize the copyright status of the individual files;
 the actual statements in the files are controlling.
 
 * Except as listed below, all C sources (including .c and .h files)
   and documentation files are subject to the copyright notice reproduced
   at the bottom of this file.
 
 * The following source files are also subject in whole or in part to
   a 3-clause UC Regents copyright; please read the individual source
   files for details:
    libarchive/archive_read_support_filter_compress.c
    libarchive/archive_write_add_filter_compress.c
    libarchive/mtree.5
 
 * The following source files are in the public domain:
    libarchive/archive_getdate.c
 
 * The following source files are triple-licensed with the ability to choose
   from CC0 1.0 Universal, OpenSSL or Apache 2.0 licenses:
    libarchive/archive_blake2.h
    libarchive/archive_blake2_impl.h
    libarchive/archive_blake2s_ref.c
    libarchive/archive_blake2sp_ref.c
 
 * The build files---including Makefiles, configure scripts,
   and auxiliary scripts used as part of the compile process---have
   widely varying licensing terms.  Please check individual files before
   distributing them to see if those restrictions apply to you.
 
 I intend for all new source code to use the license below and hope over
 time to replace code with other licenses with new implementations that
 do use the license below.  The varying licensing of the build scripts
 seems to be an unavoidable mess.

 XZ Utils Licensing
 ==================
 
     Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here
     is a summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this package:
 
       - liblzma is under the BSD Zero Clause License (0BSD).
 
       - The command line tools xz, xzdec, lzmadec, and lzmainfo are
         under 0BSD except that, on systems that don't have a usable
         getopt_long, GNU getopt_long is compiled and linked in from the
         'lib' directory. The getopt_long code is under GNU LGPLv2.1+.
 
       - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been
         adapted from GNU gzip. These scripts (xzgrep, xzdiff, xzless,
         and xzmore) are under GNU GPLv2+. The man pages of the scripts
         are under 0BSD; they aren't based on the man pages of GNU gzip.
 
       - Most of the XZ Utils specific documentation that is in
         plain text files (like README, INSTALL, PACKAGERS, NEWS,
         and ChangeLog) are under 0BSD unless stated otherwise in
         the file itself. The files xz-file-format.txt and
         lzma-file-format.xt are in the public domain but may
         be distributed under the terms of 0BSD too.
 
       - Translated messages and man pages are under 0BSD except that
         some old translations are in the public domain.
 
       - Test files and test code in the 'tests' directory, and
         debugging utilities in the 'debug' directory are under
         the BSD Zero Clause License (0BSD).
 
       - The GNU Autotools based build system contains files that are
         under GNU GPLv2+, GNU GPLv3+, and a few permissive licenses.
         These files don't affect the licensing of the binaries being
         built.
 
       - The 'extra' directory contains files that are under various
         free software licenses. These aren't built or installed as
         part of XZ Utils.
